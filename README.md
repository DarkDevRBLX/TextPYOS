# Welcome! To TextPYOS!

TextPYOS is a simpler version of older text-based operating systems, mostly MS-DOS, Linux, ect...

TextPYOS is a **full python project**, meaning that other coding languages will not be used (unless it will make it easier to do a task.)

## Development status

This project is currently in-development, but updates are likely to be infrequent due to it being developed in my free time.

Any created versions will be uploaded. All of the uploaded versions can be found under "Python Source" to make it more organized.

A community branch is still in the works.

## License

TextPYOS is open-source, under the MIT license.

For more information, please see the [MIT LICENSE](LICENSE)

Please note that it may take me a while to respond since I develop this in my free time.
