# DEVELOPMENT STATUS UPDATE:
I am still working on TextPYOS, I want to make it sort of modular with each application launching in its own window and having it's own separate application (If that makes sense)
I'm also just busy with life in general at the moment, so thank you to anyone still checking for updates!
With love, DarkDevRBLX.

# Welcome! To TextPYOS!

TextPYOS is a simpler version of older text-based operating systems, mostly MS-DOS, Linux, ect...

TextPYOS is a **full python project**, meaning that other coding languages will not be used (unless it will make it easier to do a task.)

## Development status

This project is currently in-development, but updates are likely to be infrequent due to it being developed in my free time.

Any created versions will be uploaded. All of the uploaded versions can be found under "Python Source" to make it more organized.

## License

TextPYOS is open-source, under the MIT license.

For more information, please see the [MIT LICENSE](LICENSE)

## Contact

If you have any questions, problems, or suggestions please feel free to reach out to me!

Please note that it may take me a while to respond since I develop this in my free time.
